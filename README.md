## Introduction

As the academic and scientific research is evolving rapidly, it has resulted in huge volumes of publications every year and is expected to grow similarly in the foreseeable future. Microsoft Academic Graph has nineteen Fields of Study. For effective research in any Field of Study itâ€™s mandatory to keep up with previous lecture, however not only is it wise but also impractical for researchers to keep track of all the volume of available literature considering its extreme growth. Thus researchers mostly follow or cite just a small proportion of papers which interests them, and also it is observed that some academic papers are more likely to attract researchers than the others. Citation count is a significant measure to decide the popularity of a particular paper.
